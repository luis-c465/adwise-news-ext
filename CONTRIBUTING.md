## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always
> look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

If the pull request is difficult to describe in text a picture or two is always welcome.

### Is it of good quality

- There are no spelling mistakes
- The formatting is consistent with the rest of the project
- There are no extra files that shouldn't be there
  - For example IDE files and dot files
- For english language contributions: Has a good score on
  [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) or [Hemingway
  App](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

- To show the country of origin in the search results page of popular websites
